Simple version:
GUI -> Add command to Q (e.g. blame + file_path + lines) -> check if results already in cache ->
if yes return results, else perform blame -> return results from blame

Real version:
beforehand: register events (observer pattern)
GUI -> Add command to Q (e.g. blame + file_path + lines) -> Execute on different thread when ready ->
check if results already in cache -> if yes fire up blame event with results, else perform blame ->
fire up blame event with results from blame
